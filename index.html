 <h2>Junior from Camas, Washington</h2>
 
 <p>I am a junior at Bob Jones University studying political science with a 
minor in business. I work for the Welcome Center as a student ambassador.</p>

 I enjoy participating in community outreach events, and I love spending time 
  with friends at local coffee shops. Being at college here has been
  such an incredible experience. I am so grateful for the opportunities 
  I have had to get involved in student leadrship. it has grown and taught
  me so much.

 I also enjoy hiking and watching a fun show or movie with friends.
